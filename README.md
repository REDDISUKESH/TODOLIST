  # REACT TODOLIST

## Introduction
When it comes to building a todo list application, React stands out as an excellent choice due to its component-based architecture, virtual DOM rendering, and ecosystem of libraries and tools. Here's why React is a compelling framework for developing a todo list application:

## Component-Based Architecture
React's component-based architecture allows developers to break down the UI into reusable, self-contained components. In the context of a todo list application, this means you can create separate components for the list itself, individual todo items, input forms, and any other UI elements. This modular approach simplifies development, improves code organization, and makes it easier to maintain and extend the application over time.

## State Management with useState and useEffect
React provides two essential hooks, useState and useEffect, for managing state and side effects in functional components. In a todo list application, these hooks play a crucial role in handling the list of todos and responding to user interactions.

### useState
The useState hook allows functional components to manage local state. In a todo list application, you can use useState to maintain the list of todos and track changes to individual todo items, such as their text content or completion status.

### useEffect
The useEffect hook enables functional components to perform side effects, such as fetching data, subscribing to events, or updating the DOM, in a declarative way. In a todo list application, you can use useEffect to synchronize data with external sources or perform cleanup tasks.
